- 👋 Hi, I’m @zoepe
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code. 
- It's not easy to get on the swing of things, so by joing this community I hope to get inspired by examples, and get help by asking questions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. That's it. If you say anything else I have no idea what you are talking about. 
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate, I don't think I can help you whatsoever
- 📫 How to reach me?
